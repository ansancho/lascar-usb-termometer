usb_termometer: program to use EL-USB-RT usb thermometer under linux
====================================================================
usb_termometer is a small program to retrieve temperature and humidity from 
EL-USB-RT from vendor lascar ltd (http://www.lascarelectronics.com) 

In order to compile this program you must to have in your system "libhid" 
installed. 

You can download source code and compile it from: 
http://libhid.alioth.debian.org/


known bugs
==========
Sometimes shown value (in temp or hum.)  doesn't make sense. I don't know why
it happens. I am actually testing another way to access the thermometer, for example,
sending control commands to usb device via hid_get_input_report.


Installing
==========
-Download libhid from http://libhid.alioth.debian.org/ and compile or apt-get if you
use debian like systems. You must also have installed libusb-devel.
-Make a checkout with subversion: 
svn checkout http://lascar-usb-termometer.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ lascar-usb-termometer-read-only 
or download tar.bz2 of http://code.google.com/p/lascar-usb-termometer/downloads/ and
compile.
